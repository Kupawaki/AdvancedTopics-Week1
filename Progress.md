# AdvancedTopics-Week1

The first week was more of a review than anything else. We covered toolbars and action bars in class last semester.

That isnt to say I didnt learn anything however. Before I started this project, I didn't know that action bars were actually just a layout and that they could be manipulated so freely. It was also nice to work with themes a bit, which will come in handy next week for design fundamentals.

My work with menu items and clipart was new to me. Clipart ended up being much easier and more accessable than I had anticipated, and menu items while sometimes finicky, ended up being extremely useful and a stylish way to switch activities -- far, far better than buttons.
