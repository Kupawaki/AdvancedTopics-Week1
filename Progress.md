# AdvancedTopics-Week1
The first week was more of a review than anything else. We covered toolbars and action bars in class last semester.

That isnt to say I didnt learn anything however. Before I started this project, I didn't know that action bars were actually just a layout and that they could be manipulated so freely. It was also nice to work with themes a bit, which will come in handy in a couple weeks for design fundamentals.

My work with menu items and clipart was new to me. Clipart ended up being much easier and more accessable than I had anticipated, and menu items while sometimes finicky, ended up being extremely useful and a stylish way to switch activities -- far, far better than buttons.

After I finished working with a toolbar alone, I started working with nav drawers, which were difficult. Lukcily, Android Studio has a template for me to deconstruct and rebuild. Nav drawers are awesome and useful, but I still dont understand everything about them, and is something I want to come back to. I would love to build one from scrath someday, but Dr. Hoot said that was an insane idea. Challenge Accepted.

Overall, this week I learned how to
1.) Create a custom layout file and use it as the action bar
2.) Create and edit a custom menu file
3.) Use said menu file in the action bar
4.) Set properties of the action bar dynamically upon button presses
5.) Use fragments and navigations to create and edit a nav drawer
